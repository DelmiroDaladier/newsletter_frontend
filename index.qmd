"Simply Logical -- Intelligent Reasoning by Example" by Peter Flach was firstpublished by John Wiley in 1994. It could be purchased as book-only or with a3.5 inch diskette containing the SWI-Prolog programmes printed in the book (forvarious operating systems). In 2007 the copyright reverted back to the authorat which point the book and programmes were made freely available online; theprint version is no longer distributed through John Wiley publishers. In 2015,as a pilot, we ported most of the original book into an online, interactivewebsite using SWI-Prolog's SWISH platform. Since then, we launched the SimplyLogical open source organisation committed to maintaining a suite of freelyavailable interactive online educational resources about ArtificialIntelligence and Logic Programming with Prolog. With the advent of neweducational technologies we were inspired to rebuild the book from the groundup using the Jupyter Book platform enhanced with a collection of bespokeplugins that implement, among other things, interactive SWI-Prolog code blocksthat can be executed directly in a web browser. This new version is moremodular, easier to maintain, and can be split into custom teaching modules, inaddition to being modern-looking, visually appealing, and compatible with arange of (mobile) devices of varying screen sizes.
